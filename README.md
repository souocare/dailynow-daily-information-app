## Technologies Used
- **Flutter Framework with Dart**: The DailyNow App was developed using the Flutter framework. Flutter allowed me to build a single codebase for both Android and iOS platforms, providing a seamless and consistent user experience.

- **Firebase and Hive Databases**: To ensure efficient data storage and retrieval, we utilized Firebase Realtime Database for user authentication and real-time updates on user data. Additionally, Hive Database was used to provide offline access of Metro of Lisbon stations, enhancing the app's performance even in the absence of an internet connection.

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: The app integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to deliver accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts, allowing uses to quickly access weather information based on their current location

- **OpenStreetMap API**: For an interactive and user-friendly experience, the OpenStreetMap API was used to display the map of the Lisbon Metro. This enabled users to locate nearby metro stations.

- **Metro Lisboa API**: It uses Metro Lisboa API to fetch real-time data on metro schedules (when available) and estimated arrival times. This feature ensures users are well-informed about public transportation.

 - **RSS Feeds**: To keep users informed with the latest news, the app utilizes RSS Feeds to aggregate news from various reliable sources. This feature enables users to stay up-to-date with current events and relevant headlines within the app.
